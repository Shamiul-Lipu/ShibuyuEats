# ShibuyuEats

A simple React app built with React & React Router Dom and authentication integrated with firebase, server side hosted in vercel. 

**ShibuyuEats is a website dedicated to sharing Japanese cuisine recipes created by some of the best Japanese chefs. The website offers a wide variety of authentic and innovative dishes, ranging from traditional Japanese classics to modern fusion creations.**

*The Home component that imports React and three other components: Link, Chefs, Member, and Reviews. It renders a section with a banner, featuring a hero image and text, followed by sections for displaying chefs, members, and reviews. The banner section has a button that links to the login page. The chefs, members, and reviews sections are implemented through the imported components. 
*Header component with menu navigation, user display and conditional login/logout functionality. 
*Chef component that fetches data from an API and renders it as a grid of ChefCards using LazyLoad for performance optimization. chefcards renders a chef card with their name, experience, number of recipes, likes, and a button to view their recipes.
*View their recipes is a protected route which lead to specific chefs recipes details and their details.
*Main app wraped by authprovider that way we can access user's data from any where. Authprovider exports an authentication provider component with Firebase authentication, and an AuthContext that contains user and sign-in methods.
